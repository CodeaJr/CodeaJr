### Hi, I'm André!

I'm André from Brazil, and I am a Computer Science student. I really enjoy working with Data Structures, Algorithms and AI, and I'm planning on studying Cybersecurity and Production Engineering. I'm currently learning a lot of project management fundamentals, Python, and a lot of SQL as well. You can check my progress at https://leetcode.com/u/andrecodea/ and https://roadmap.sh/u/andrecodea. If you want to know more, check my LinkedIn profile at https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrecodea.
